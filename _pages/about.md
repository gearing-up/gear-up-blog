I really enjoy being outdoors, hiking/running/skiing/cycling/paddling/camping,  during all seasons, for short or longer trips.
As many similar minded people, I got quite a collection of outdoor clothing and gear.
Over the last of couple years, I have made quite a few modifications to my outdoor gear, or even made my own gear from scratch.
I thought it would be nice to document some of those activities, primarily for my own benefit.
I am actually not that socially inclined and have a healthy dislike of social media, so maintaining a _blog_ feels a bit awkward.
Anyway, now that you are here, take a look at some of my "projects" and feel free to copy/modify anything you like.
